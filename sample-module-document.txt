MODULE 1: FOUNDATIONS OF DATA SCIENCE
================================================================================

Unit 1.1: What is Data Science?

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.

Big Data refers to extremely large datasets that may be analyzed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations.

Unit 1.2: The Data Science Process

Data Collection is the process of gathering and measuring information on targeted variables in an established system. It enables one to answer relevant questions and evaluate outcomes.

Data Cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting corrupt or inaccurate records from a dataset. It involves identifying incomplete, incorrect, or irrelevant parts of the data.

Unit 1.3: Tools and Technologies

Python is a high-level programming language widely used in data science for its simplicity and powerful libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

R Programming is a language and environment specifically designed for statistical computing and graphics.

MODULE 2: STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Unit 2.1: Descriptive Statistics

Mean is the average of a set of numbers, calculated by adding all values and dividing by the count of values.

Median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order.

Standard Deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values.

Unit 2.2: Inferential Statistics

Hypothesis Testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data.

P-Value is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

Confidence Interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence.

Unit 2.3: Probability Theory

Probability Distribution is a mathematical function that provides the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes in an experiment.

Bayes Theorem describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

MODULE 3: MACHINE LEARNING FUNDAMENTALS
================================================================================

Unit 3.1: Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled training data to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Classification is a supervised learning task where the goal is to predict discrete class labels for input data.

Regression is a supervised learning technique used to predict continuous numerical values based on input features.

Unit 3.2: Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised Learning is a type of machine learning that finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in unlabeled data.

Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects such that objects in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.

Dimensionality Reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables.

Unit 3.3: Model Evaluation

Cross-Validation is a resampling technique used to evaluate machine learning models by training and testing on different portions of the data.

Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, resulting in poor performance on new data.

Accuracy is the ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations in a classification model.

MODULE 4: DATA VISUALIZATION
================================================================================

Unit 4.1: Visualization Principles

Data Visualization is the graphical representation of information and data using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics using visual methods.

Unit 4.2: Visualization Tools

Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

Tableau is a powerful data visualization tool used in business intelligence to simplify raw data into easily understandable formats.

Unit 4.3: Advanced Visualizations

Heatmap is a data visualization technique that shows the magnitude of a phenomenon as color in two dimensions.

Interactive Dashboard is a visual display of data that allows users to interact with and explore the information dynamically.
