Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can identify patterns and make decisions based on data.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning - Uses labeled data to train models
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finds patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning - Learns through trial and error

Key Concepts:
- Training Data: The dataset used to teach the model
- Features: Input variables used for predictions
- Labels: Output variables we want to predict
- Model: The mathematical representation learned from data

Applications of machine learning include image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.
